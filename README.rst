Django-Live Demo Project
========================

This is a project originally put together as a demo to accompany a lightning
talk at DjangoCon 2012.

The purpose is to demonstrate a set of techniques to bridge Django into
the playground of realtime web apps.

The goal is to show one way that a realtime interface can coexist with the conventional
request response oriented architecture of Django.

I've made and effort to annotate the code, and also worked on developing
patterns that might be more generally applicable.
